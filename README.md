# TownManager
###A specialized save manager for AC:NL

## What is it?
Once set up, TownManager allows you to choose from a list of AC:NL towns to launch.

## How does it work?

### Starting out
When TownManager is first launched, it creates a TownManager directory under your SD root as well as a "Saves" directory inside of that which holds your save files. After this, it automatically backs up your current saves to a folder called "Main" located in /TownManager/Saves. From there, you just select the town you want to launch and then hit "Launch town" and the game starts up. Once you're finished playing the game, make sure you run TownManager and it will back up your saves again to Main.

### Creating a new town
To create a new town, simply select the "New" button and a keyboard will appear in the bottom screen. You should enter the name you will give your new AC:NL town. After you hit "OK", TownManager will wipe your cartridge and you will start out fresh. Remember that it backed your saves up to "Main" so you don't need to worry about losing data. Create your town in game and save. The next time you enter TownManager, it will back up your saves to the new town folder you just created. TownManager remembers the last town you launched.


### Selecting a town
This is pretty self explanatory. You just select the town you want to play, then hit "Launch town" and the game opens.
